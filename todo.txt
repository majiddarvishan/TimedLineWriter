Use std::ios::binary (safer for perf)
Use std::condition_variable::wait_until
Avoid unnecessary date checks


ðŸ”Œ Offload flushing to a dedicated thread for overlapping compute/I/O

Would you like to add metrics (e.g. flushed line count, write latency) or move to io_uring for kernel-level async I/O next?

Add metrics (e.g., pool utilization, dropped writes)?
